## üß© Prompt for AI / Copy Assistant

**Title:**  
> Redesign Flumberico Landing Page for Simplicity, Credibility, and Visual Balance

**Prompt Body:**
> Flumberico is an AI platform that automatically hunts and applies for dream jobs.  
> We already have a draft homepage, but it‚Äôs too text-heavy, repetitive, and unclear.  
> Please **rewrite and redesign** the homepage so that:
>
> - The **hero section** is understandable in 5 seconds, with a clear single-line value proposition.  
> - Each section includes **visual or image suggestions** to balance the layout.  
> - **Testimonials** and **Founder section** have real, believable human elements (photo, quote, short bio).  
> - All data/claims are **realistic and narrative-driven** ‚Äî avoid overclaiming.  
> - The **job application funnel** makes logical sense:
>   - Step 1: Collect name + email  
>   - Step 2: Ask for LinkedIn URL or CV upload  
>   - Step 3: Show AI-fit role demo ‚Üí CTA for early access  
> - The **UpViral referral funnel** should be easy to follow:
>   - After opt-in ‚Üí user sees ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the list!‚Äù  
>   - Step 2: Prompt to ‚ÄúShare Flumberico to unlock instant access‚Äù  
> - Tone should be **modern, credible, and slightly witty**, similar to Notion or Copy.ai.  
> - Use short, skimmable text sections and avoid big paragraphs.  
>
> **Keep these core elements:**
> - Hero headline: ‚ÄúFlumberico applies to 200+ perfect-fit jobs per month with custom resumes ‚Äî while you sleep.‚Äù
> - Subline: ‚ÄúYour Dream Job in 30 Days ‚Äî or Flumberico Pays You $500.‚Äù
> - CTA: ‚ÄúJoin the Waitlist‚Äù + ‚ÄúRefer 3 Friends to Skip the Line.‚Äù
>
> **Add believable social proof:**  
> Example stats:  
> - ‚Äú3,800+ early users already on the waitlist.‚Äù  
> - ‚Äú83% report getting interviews within 30 days.‚Äù  
>
> **End with a clear closing CTA section:**  
> - ‚ÄúJoin Flumberico ‚Äî Launching March 1, 2025.‚Äù  
> - ‚ÄúRefer 3 friends to skip the waitlist.‚Äù
