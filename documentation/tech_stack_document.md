# Tech Stack Document for Flumberico Landing Page

This document explains, in simple terms, the key technologies and services that power the Flumberico landing page. It’s designed for non-technical readers, so you’ll understand why each choice was made and how it helps the project.

## Frontend Technologies

The frontend is everything you see and interact with in your browser. Here’s what we use:

- **Next.js**  
  A React framework that lets us mix server-side rendering (SSR) with static site generation (SSG). This means pages load fast and rank well in search engines.
- **React**  
  The core library for building interactive user interfaces with reusable components.
- **TypeScript**  
  Adds type checking to JavaScript, reducing bugs and making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Tailwind CSS**  
  A utility-first styling tool that speeds up design by letting us apply styles directly in our HTML-like code.
- **Framer Motion**  
  A library for smooth, attractive animations—used for background effects and form transitions.
- **Lucide React**  
  A set of customizable, lightweight SVG icons that match our brand’s look and feel.

How these choices enhance the experience:

- Consistent styling and quick layout changes with Tailwind CSS
- Fast initial page loads and clear SEO benefits from Next.js
- Engaging animations courtesy of Framer Motion
- Fewer runtime errors and clearer code thanks to TypeScript

## Backend Technologies

Although Flumberico is primarily a landing page, we still rely on server-side logic for rendering and any small APIs we might add:

- **Next.js Server Functions**  
  Built-in serverless functions for handling any form submissions or light data processing without setting up a separate server.
- **Node.js Runtime**  
  The environment where our Next.js code runs, hosted seamlessly on Vercel.

These components work together to deliver dynamic content (like personalized onboarding steps) and keep the site fast and reliable.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

How we host and deploy the site:

- **Vercel**  
  A hosting platform optimized for Next.js that automatically handles builds, deployments, and global CDN distribution.
- **Git + GitHub**  
  Version control system where all code lives. Every change is tracked, reviewed, and merged using pull requests.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (Vercel)**  
  Continuous integration and deployment happen automatically whenever we push code to the main branch.

Benefits:

- Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollbacks if something goes wrong
- Fast global delivery via Vercel’s CDN, ensuring quick loads everywhere
- Easy collaboration and code history tracking through GitHub

## Third-Party Integrations

To extend functionality without reinventing the wheel, we connect to a few external services:

- **Google Search Console**  
  Site verification and monitoring of how the page performs in Google search results.
- **Waitlist/Referral Service**  
  External forms or links that collect user sign-ups and referrals, keeping our core codebase focused on the landing page itself.

These integrations help us track performance, collect leads, and grow our user base with minimal setup.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Keeping the site safe and speedy:

- **HTTPS Everywhere**  
  Automatic SSL certificates from Vercel ensure all data is encrypted in transit.
- **SEO & Meta Tags**  
  Configured in Next.js to improve search rankings and social media previews.
- **Code Splitting**  
  Next.js only loads the JavaScript needed for each page, reducing initial download size.
- **Image Optimization**  
  Built-in Next.js features lazy-load images and serve them in modern formats when possible.
- **Type Safety**  
  TypeScript reduces runtime errors, helping prevent certain classes of security bugs.

These measures work together to deliver a secure, fast experience for every visitor.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

In building the Flumberico landing page, we chose a modern, maintainable stack that balances performance, developer productivity, and a polished user experience. Key highlights:

- Next.js and React for a fast, SEO-friendly site
- Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for consistent, engaging design
- TypeScript for safer, more predictable code
- Vercel for seamless hosting, deployments, and global speed
- Essential integrations like Google Search Console and a referral system for growth and monitoring

Together, these technologies help us present Flumberico’s AI-powered job matching service clearly and engagingly, while making it easy for our team to iterate and improve over time.
